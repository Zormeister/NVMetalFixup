Well mind, well code. Bad mind, bad code.

## wtf was this even doing

wrapping the native drivers and lobotomising it so it gets fed web driver code

*yeah that didn't work*

anyways i came up with an idea that sounded good on paper at one point, bridge the NVRM from native to NVRMWeb

never actually did it but i could persue that in the future who knows, my GTX 1050 Ti still works anyways

rest in pieces NVMetalFixup, you will not be missed
